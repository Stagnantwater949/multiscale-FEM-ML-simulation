# Multiscale Modelling of Materials Using Machine Learning

This project explores the integration of Finite Element Method (FEM) with Machine Learning to study the deformation behavior of an Aluminium 6061 nozzle, incorporating grain size as a microstructural feature.

## Project Highlights
- FEM simulation performed in Abaqus to model stress-strain response of a nozzle under loading.
- Synthetic data generated to simulate grain size variation at the microscale.
- Machine learning models trained to link microstructural features (grain size) with material response.

## Tools Used
- Abaqus (FEM simulation)
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

## Files Included
- `report.pdf` – Full project report
- `synthetic_data.csv` – Sample dataset used for training
- `photos` - some are results and some are obtained during the procedure
- Abaqus job files

## Outcome
Improved accuracy in predicting deformation behavior by integrating microstructural insights into macroscale FEM simulations.
